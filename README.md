-> What is Java 
   Java is high-level, object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems which is now owned by Oracle Technologies.

-> How Java is high-level language ?
  1. Abstracts the details away from computer making it easier to write and understand code.
  2. Java is platform independent (Programs are compiled into bytecode and can run on any device which has JVM)
  3. Java has libraries and various frameworks,supports object-oriented programming and handles memory management automatically.
  4. Java has human-readable syntax,strong error checking that enhance productivity.

-> How Java is Object-Oriented Programming language
  1. Java uses class as blueprint to create objects
  2. Data and method are bundled into single unit so any other class can't access it directly
  3. New classes can inherit attributes and methods from existing class (code reusability)
  4. Complex details are hidden, simplifying interaction with objects.

-> Key features of Java
  1. Simple : Java is easy to learn and use. It removes many complex and error-prone features found in other languages.
  2. Object- Oriented : It is Object-Oriented language promotes modularity and code reusability.
  3. Platform Independent : Java is platform independent language ( code compiled into bytecode and can run on any machine which has JVM).
  4. Robust : Java supports early error-checking, removes error prone constructs like pointer. Java has automatic memory management.
  5. Multithreading: Java has built in multithreading feature that allows developers to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
  6. Interpreted and Compiled: Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted or compiled at runtime by the JVM.
  7. Rich Libraries : Java has extensive libraries that includes APIs for data structures,networking,input/output,GUI and more simplifying developement.
